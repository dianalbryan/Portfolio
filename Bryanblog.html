		<h1>Brief</h1>
		<p>Design briefs always seem like they should be intuitive. We work on making sure things are clear and easy to understand, as well as measurable, but in the end, it seems like what we’re doing is more laying out for ourselves and others, what we’re planning in the clearest terms we can so that if we need to go back to what we’re doing, we’ll remember.</p>
		
		<p>In a lot of ways, if I were to put it in English terms, it would remind me of an outline. Briefs are guides, not just for the designer but also for the client. It’s a way for them to see what to expect in the future, and for, if there are any problems, them to be noticed and changed before they become a larger problem in the future. When a client sees something they aren’t sure that they like, or something else that they think might work better, they can talk to the designer quickly, talk about potential changes, consider things early, rather than when there is a nearly completely project.</p>
		
		
		<p>This isn’t to say that there will be no changes. Even after a brief, other changes might occur if the client wishes to add something more or changes their mind to a particular concept. However, the fact doesn’t change that a completed brief gives client and designer a direction, and can make sure that a project is one the right foot from the very beginning.</p>
